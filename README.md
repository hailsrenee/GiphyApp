# GiphyApp

I built this GiphyApp using the Giphy API.

I started with pre-selected topics in an array, using gifs that I would use to react to certain situations.

New buttons can be created and searched by typing in the input form and clicking the button.

Each GIF is shown in the paused form but can be animated by clicking the GIF. It can also be stopped if clicked again.
